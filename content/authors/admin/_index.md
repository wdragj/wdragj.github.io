Hello! My name is Freddy Seo and I am currently a second-year Computer Science student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, intending a focus on Software Development.

I am an energetic and passionate college student aiming to use the knowledge and skills that I have acquired from coursework, projects, previous internship, and self study to become an experienced software developer.

Other than that, I really like coffee...
