**Docker Images** are read-only templates comprised of multiple layers which act as a blueprint of the container environment.

Docker Images are built by specifying instructions inside a special file called **Dockerfile**.

Dockerfile allows us to define instructions to create a customized container environment.

We can execute the Docker build command on a Dockerfile to create a Docker Image.

This Docker image can then be used to create one or more instances of Docker containers associated with that image.

### **Running Containers from Docker Image**

Steps to create a Docker Image and run a Container

**Step 1:**

* Create a Dockerfile.

**Step 2:**

* Run the following command in the terminal and it will create a docker image of the application and download all the necessary dependencies needed for the application to run successfully.
* `docker build -t <tag to give to your image>`
* This will start building the image.

**Step 3:**

* We have successfully created a Dockerfile and a respective Docker image for the same.

**Step 4:**

* Run the following command in the terminal and it will create a running container with all the needed dependencies and start the application.
* `docker run -p 9000:80 <tag-name>`
* The 9000 is the port we want to access our application on.
* 80 is the port the container is exposing for the host to access.

### Useful Docker Image commands:

`docker images` See the list of Docker images on the system

`docker build -t <tag name> .` Build the container image

`docker run -dp 3000:3000 <tag name>` Start the app container using the image

`docker rmi <Image ID>` Removing Docker Images

`docker images -q` Return the Image IDâ€™s only

`docker inspect <name>` Used to see the details fo an image or container
